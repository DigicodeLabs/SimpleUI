# SimpleUI
SimpleUI will be a desktop UI for AppGameKit.

This is currently not a full or even useable UI set at the moment. This first public release is to just to receive feedback.

At the moment all you can do with this UI is create panels, and to those panels you can add labels, dividers, and scrollviews. To each scrollview you can add labels and dividers.

This repository comes with a demo project which you can open in AGK.
